This is an open source Silverlight application for use with Windows Phone 7. It uses code adapted from the "google-authenticator" project.

The code in here comes with NO guaranties for working. Also, I've probably broken various cardinal rules of programming in this code. As far as I know it all works on the VS WP7 Emulator. I have not tested this on a live phone. If someone encounters problems, feel free to email me and I can have it fixed.

As a side note, to deploy this to a live phone, the phone needs to be developer unlocked. I am not a WP7 app developer and as such this app will not appear in the app market. I have deliberately left out the "Google" name in the app and code for legal purposes.
